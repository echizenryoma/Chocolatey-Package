      This is a fork of ioerror's version of sslscan (the original readme of which is included below).
      Key changes are as follows:
      
      * Highlight SSLv2 and SSLv3 ciphers in output.
      * Highlight CBC ciphers on SSLv3 (POODLE).
      * Highlight 3DES and RC4 ciphers in output.
      * Highlight PFS+GCM ciphers as good in output.
      * Highlight NULL (0 bit), weak (<40 bit) and medium (40 < n <= 56) ciphers in output.
      * Highlight anonymous (ADH and AECDH) ciphers in output (purple).
      * Hide certificate information by default (display with `--get-certificate`).
      * Hide rejected ciphers by default (display with `--failed`).
      * Added TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3 support.
      * Supports IPv6  (can be forced with `--ipv6`).
      * Check for TLS compression (CRIME, disable with `--no-compression`).
      * Disable cipher suite checking `--no-ciphersuites`.
      * Disable coloured output `--no-colour`.
      * Removed undocumented -p output option.
      * Added check for OpenSSL HeartBleed (CVE-2014-0160, disable with `--no-heartbleed`).
      * Flag certificates signed with MD5 or SHA-1, or with short (<2048 bit) RSA keys.
      * Support scanning RDP servers with `--rdp` (credit skettler).
      * Added option to specify socket timeout.
      * Added option for static compilation (credit dmke).
      * Added `--sleep` option to pause between requests.
      * Disable output for anything than specified checks `--no-preferred`.
      * Determine the list of CAs acceptable for client certificates `--show-client-cas`.
      * Experimental build support on OS X (credit MikeSchroll).
      * Flag some self-signed SSL certificates.
      * Experimental Windows support (credit jtesta).
      * Display EC curve names and DHE key lengths with OpenSSL >= 1.0.2 `--no-cipher-details`.
      * Flag weak DHE keys with OpenSSL >= 1.0.2 `--cipher-details`.
      * Flag expired certificates.
      * Flag TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 protocols in output as weak.
      * Experimental OS X support (static building only).
      * Support for scanning PostgreSQL servers (credit nuxi).
      * Check for TLS Fallback SCSV support.
      * Added StartTLS support for LDAP `--starttls-ldap`.
      * Added SNI support `--sni-name` (credit Ken).
      * Support STARTTLS for MySQL (credit bk2017).
      * Check for supported key exchange groups.
      * Check for supported server signature algorithms.
      * Display IANA/RFC cipher names `--iana-names`s
